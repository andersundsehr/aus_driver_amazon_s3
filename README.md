# TYPO3 Extension: Amazon AWS S3 FAL driver (CDN)

This is a driver for the file abstraction layer (FAL) to support Amazon AWS S3.

You can create a file storage which allows you to upload/download and link the files to an AWS S3 bucket. It also supports the TYPO3 CMS image rendering.

Requires TYPO3 6.2 - 8.x

Packagist: [andersundsehr/aus-driver-amazon-s3](https://packagist.org/packages/andersundsehr/aus-driver-amazon-s3)


## Installation

1.  Install the TYPO3 extension via composer (recommended) or install the extension via TER (not recommended anymore).

> Composer installation:
>
> ```bash
> composer require andersundsehr/aus-driver-amazon-s3
> ```

1.  Add a new file storage with the “Amazon S3” driver to root page (pid = 0).
2.  Configure your file storage

## Configuration

### Driver Configuration

Add the following configurations:

-   Bucket: The name of your AWS S3 bucket
-   Region: The region of your bucket (avoid dots in the bucket name)
-   Key and secret key of your AWS account (see security credentials -&gt; access keys)
-   Public base url (optional): this is the public url of your bucket, if empty its default to “bucketname.s3.amazonaws.com”
-   Protocol: network protocol (https://, http:// or auto detection)

#### Hint: Amazon AWS S3 bucket configuration

Make sure that your AWS S3 bucket is accessible to public web users.

For example add the following default permissions to “Edit bucket policy”:

Example permissions:

```json
{
  "Version": "2008-10-17",
  "Statement": [
      {
          "Sid": "AddPerm",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": "*",
          "Action": "s3:GetObject",
          "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::bucketname/*"
      }
  ]
}
```

### Extension Configuration

Edit in “Extension Manager” the following extension settings:

-   Use DNS prefetching tag: If enabled, a HTML tag will be included which prefetchs the DNS of the current CDN
-   Don’t load Amazon AWS PHP SDK: If enabled, you have to include this files by yourself! (<http://aws.amazon.com/de/sdk-for-php/>)

## Extend Extension

If you use your own Amazon AWS SDK, you may want to work with your own S3 client object.

So you have to use the following hook in your own ext\_loaclconf.php:

```php
$GLOBALS['TYPO3_CONF_VARS']['EXTCONF']['aus_driver_amazon_s3']['initializeClient-preProcessing'][] = \Vendor\ExtensionName\Hooks\AmazonS3DriverHook::class . '->initializeClient';
```

A hook class might look like this:

```php
namespace Vendor\ExtensionName\Hooks;

class AmazonS3DriverHook {

  public function initializeClient(array &$params, $obj){
    $params['s3Client'] = MyAwsFactory::getAwsS3Client($params['configuration']);
  }
}
```

If you wish other hooks - don’t be shy: [GitHub issue tracking: Amazon S3 FAL Driver](https://github.com/andersundsehr/aus_driver_amazon_s3/issues)
